Chicago Coronavirus Website

It is important for most, if not all, people to get vaccinated in order for them to get protected against the coronavirus and stop the spread. However, there might be people who are unaware where to get vaccinated or get tested if they feel COVID-19-like symptoms. This website is designed so that the Chicagoans will be able to locate where they can get tested or vaccinated dependng on their address. 

The homepage displays infographics to give information about the progress of the fight against the virus and other important reminders.

The Testing Sites page allows the user to search for a COVID19 testing site near or around his neighborhood.

The Vaccine Sites page allows the user to search for facilities where he or she can get vaccinated.


Technical Details

This project was developed using HTML, CSS, and jQuery.
